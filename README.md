# csgopool
A CS:GO Pro Players Pool

### Purpose

Our goal is to make a website with a CS:GO Pro players pool. Like for many sports, we want to create a game by choosing CS:GO pro players and with their
 performance, participant will gain some points. All the participants will be ranked by their points. We want to make small season, like 4-6 months pool.
 We want to add a bet system when the pool system will be completed and tested. Maybe a SteamMarket Bet like we can do in CSGO Lounge.
